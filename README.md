Hello everyone. I'm Sarves and I'm 19 years old. I'm currently pursuing bachelor's of Computer Science (Bioinformatics) at [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](https://www.utm.my/)
I have particular interest in novels where I tend to loose time when I've started a novel. The skills I've mastered are editing in apps such as [Canva](https://www.canva.com) and [Capcut](https://www.capcut.com/)
